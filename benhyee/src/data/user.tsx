				My career has taken me on an exciting journey through various fields and roles in technology.
				I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a degree in Electrical Engineering and worked at Amazon Go in Seattle.
				During my time, I got to explore various EE fields, including manufacturing, Firmware development, and hardware design.
				I left in 2024 to move back to LA and grow my skills in various stacks of software development.
				I had the opportunity to learn ML/AI best practices and freelance as an full-stack IOS developer to build my very own app.

				content: `
					Outside of work, I am very active with my hobbies. 
					I climb at least twice a week at a V9 | 5.12C level, mainly at Hollywood Boulders and The Post in Pasadena.
					I grew up playing tennis and still actively rally at a USTA 4.5 level. 
					Recently, I picked up Pickleball, which I enjoy as an accessible and social sport. 
					Additionally, I have a dog named Remy, who I've raised since she was a puppy. 
					She kept me sane through the pandemic and is a wonderful companion. 
					These activities not only keep me fit but also provide a perfect balance to my tech-focused career.
